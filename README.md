# Habit_Tracker

## Project Rationale

Habits Tracker is a web application made with Django that helps users keep track of, create, dleete  and look after their daily habits. User’s can add new habits, check there progress, tick off ones they’ve finished, edit any details that changed, and delete habits they don’t need anymore. Each user has their own private account so all their habit info stays personal and secure, without anyone else being able to see it. The whole idea was to make something simple that isn’t over complicated or confussing for people to use.

This app is mainly made for people who want to build better routiens or just try get more organised in thier day-to-day life. It works well for anyone who struggles keeping on top of habits, forgets what they planned to do, or just wants something simple to help keep them motivated.

### Features
###  Existing Features
navbar:
-The navbar shows up at the top of every page so ppl can find their way around easier.
nav-links: 
Home (where the list of habits is)
Login / Register (only if the user isn’t signed in)
Logout (only shown when the user is logged in)

When someone logs in, the navbar “switches” so the login link switches to a logout button.

On mobile screens the navbar collapses down into a lil hamburger menu thanks to Bootstrap’s responsive classes (so it doesn’t take up the whole screen).

The logo/link of“Habit Tracker” always links back to the homepage.
